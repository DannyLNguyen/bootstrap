                                                <p>The role of a Sr.Loan Officer is very involved in the day to day loan process. After initially the relationship, being a call or email away helped answering any questions or addressing any concerns along the way. Email is the primary source of communication other than the phone itself, naturally I grew quite comfortable around computers and the tech involved. Having to learn and opporate new programs was a routine and key in my success.</p>

Among all of the other duties required, I also installed and serviced both the lottery machine and the POS system. Every holiday season, I would organize a toy drive which became an annual tradition. The last year of the drive we were able to create partnerships with manufacturers and ended up with over 50,000 toys donated!  </p>

                                                <p>Creating a business from ground up is never an easy task. It was a challenge not only did I take head on but it was also an environment I thrived in. Being a fully functional screenprinting shop required knowledge of programs such as Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop in order to design or render client artwork in order to print. Taking short classes provided by Ryonet and local supply stores helped me navigate my otherwise self taught journey.</p>
